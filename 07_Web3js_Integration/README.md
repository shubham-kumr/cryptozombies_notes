# Web3.js Integration Notes

Welcome to the **Web3.js Integration** section of CryptoZombies Notes! In this module, you'll learn how to connect your smart contracts to JavaScript using Web3.js, and how to write automated tests for your DApp. You'll explore setup, contract connection, interaction, event handling, ownership, and marketplace integration, building a robust test suite step by step.

## How to Use This Module
Each `.js` file in this directory is a lesson focusing on a specific aspect of Web3.js integration or contract testing. Files are heavily commented for clarity. Work through them in order for the best learning experience. Read the comments, experiment with the code, and refer back to the summaries below as needed.

## File-by-File Summaries

### 01_web3_setup.js
**Topic:** Setting up Web3.js

- Demonstrates how to require contract artifacts and set up a test suite using Mocha/Chai.
- Prepares the environment for writing and running contract tests.
- **Why it matters:** Proper setup is essential for reliable and maintainable DApp testing.

### 02_contract_connection.js
**Topic:** Connecting to the contract

- Shows how to deploy a new contract instance and connect to it in tests.
- Demonstrates the use of test accounts for simulating different users.
- **Why it matters:** Contract connection is the foundation for all further interaction and testing.

### 03_contract_interaction.js
**Topic:** Interacting with the contract

- Demonstrates how to call contract methods and assert on results and events.
- Shows how to create zombies and check for correct event emission.
- **Why it matters:** Interaction tests ensure your contract logic works as expected.

### 04_event_listeners.js
**Topic:** Listening for contract events

- Shows how to listen for and assert on contract events in tests.
- Demonstrates the use of hooks (beforeEach) for test setup.
- **Why it matters:** Event tests verify that your contract emits the correct events for DApp integration.

### 05_zombie_ownership.js
**Topic:** Managing zombie ownership

- Implements tests for ownership logic, including preventing duplicate zombies per user.
- Demonstrates the use of helper utilities for error handling.
- **Why it matters:** Ownership tests are critical for security and user experience in DApps.

### 06_zombie_marketplace.js
**Topic:** Marketplace integration

- Adds tests for transfer and approval scenarios, including single-step and two-step transfers.
- Prepares the test suite for advanced marketplace features.
- **Why it matters:** Marketplace tests ensure your DApp supports trading and advanced user flows.

## Tips for Success
- Read the comments in each file carefullyâ€”they explain not just the "how" but the "why."
- Experiment with the code: try changing test cases, adding new scenarios, or breaking things to see what happens.
- Refer back to this README and the main course notes as needed.
- Practice writing your own contract tests using these patterns and techniques.
