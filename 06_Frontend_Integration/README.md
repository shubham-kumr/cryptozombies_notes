## How to Use This Module
Each file in this directory is a lesson focusing on a specific aspect of frontend integration with Ethereum smart contracts. Files are heavily commented for clarity. Work through them in order for the best learning experience. Read the comments, experiment with the code, and refer back to the summaries below as needed.

## File-by-File Summaries

### 01_web3_setup.html
**Topic:** Setting up Web3 in the frontend

- Demonstrates how to include Web3.js and jQuery in your HTML.
- Sets up the basic HTML structure for a DApp frontend.
- **Why it matters:** Web3.js is the bridge between your smart contracts and the browser.

### 02_web3_connection.html
**Topic:** Connecting to the blockchain

- Shows how to detect and connect to a user's Ethereum provider (e.g., MetaMask).
- Explains how to initialize Web3 and handle cases where the provider is missing.
- **Why it matters:** Securely connecting to the blockchain is the first step for any DApp.

### 03_contract_interaction.html
**Topic:** Interacting with contracts

- Demonstrates how to instantiate a contract in JavaScript using its ABI and address.
- Shows how to call contract methods from the frontend.
- **Why it matters:** Contract interaction is essential for reading and writing blockchain data from the UI.

### 04_contract_events.sol
**Topic:** Handling contract events

- Shows how to call contract methods to fetch data (zombie details, ownership, etc.).
- Prepares the frontend for listening to contract events and updating the UI.
- **Why it matters:** Event handling enables real-time updates and a responsive user experience.

### 05_event_listeners.html
**Topic:** Listening for events in the UI

- Demonstrates how to listen for blockchain events and update the UI when the user's account changes.
- Shows how to fetch and display user-specific data in real time.
- **Why it matters:** Event listeners keep the UI in sync with the blockchain and user actions.

### 06_zombie_ownership.sol
**Topic:** Ownership logic

- Implements logic for displaying zombies owned by the current user.
- Shows how to fetch and render zombie details dynamically in the UI.
- **Why it matters:** Ownership logic is key for personalizing the DApp and showing user assets.

### 07_zombie_display.html
**Topic:** Displaying zombies in the UI

- Demonstrates how to display a list of zombies and their attributes in the frontend.
- Shows how to update the UI after contract interactions (e.g., creating or feeding zombies).
- **Why it matters:** A dynamic display keeps users informed and engaged with their assets.

### 08_zombie_interaction.html
**Topic:** Interacting with zombies

- Adds UI logic for creating zombies, feeding them, and leveling up.
- Demonstrates how to handle transactions, show status updates, and respond to user actions.
- **Why it matters:** Interactive features make the DApp engaging and fun to use.

### 09_zombie_marketplace.html
**Topic:** Marketplace UI

- Integrates event listeners for blockchain events (e.g., transfers) to update the UI in real time.
- Demonstrates advanced UI logic for marketplace features and asset management.
- **Why it matters:** Marketplace integration enables trading and enhances the DApp's utility.

## Tips for Success
- Read the comments in each file carefullyâ€”they explain not just the "how" but the "why."
- Experiment with the code: try changing values, adding new UI features, or breaking things to see what happens.
- Refer back to this README and the main course notes as needed.
- Practice building your own DApp frontends using these patterns and techniques.
