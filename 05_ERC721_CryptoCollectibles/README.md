# ERC721 CryptoCollectibles Notes

Welcome to the **ERC721 CryptoCollectibles** section of CryptoZombies Notes! In this module, you'll learn how to implement the ERC721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum. You'll explore ownership, approval, transfers, metadata, events, marketplaces, and auctions, building a complete collectible system step by step.

## File-by-File Summaries

### 01_erc721_intro.sol
**Topic:** Introduction to ERC721

- Sets up the initial contract structure for ERC721-based collectibles.
- Prepares the codebase for adding ERC721 functionality.
- **Why it matters:** Understanding the contract structure is the first step to implementing the standard.

### 02_erc721_implementation.sol
**Topic:** Basic implementation

- Introduces inheritance from the ERC721 interface.
- Sets up the contract to comply with the ERC721 standard.
- **Why it matters:** Inheriting from ERC721 is required for compatibility with wallets and marketplaces.

### 03_erc721_balance.sol
**Topic:** Balance and ownership functions

- Implements `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` functions to track token ownership.
- Sets up the structure for transfer and approval functions.
- **Why it matters:** These functions are core to the ERC721 standard and enable user wallets to track their NFTs.

### 04_erc721_ownership.sol
**Topic:** Ownership management

- Adds modifiers and functions to enforce and manage token ownership.
- Demonstrates secure access control for token actions.
- **Why it matters:** Proper ownership management is essential for security and user trust.

### 05_erc721_approval.sol
**Topic:** Approval system

- Introduces the approval mechanism for allowing others to transfer tokens on your behalf.
- Sets up internal transfer logic and event emission.
- **Why it matters:** Approvals are necessary for marketplaces and delegated transfers.

### 06_erc721_transfer.sol
**Topic:** Transfer functionality

- Implements the `transferFrom` function and approval checks.
- Adds internal transfer logic and approval mapping.
- **Why it matters:** Secure and flexible transfer logic is at the heart of NFT ownership.

### 07_erc721_metadata.sol
**Topic:** Metadata handling

- Adds support for token metadata and the `approve` function with access control.
- Demonstrates how to associate data with each NFT.
- **Why it matters:** Metadata enables rich, descriptive NFTs and compatibility with platforms like OpenSea.

### 08_erc721_events.sol
**Topic:** Event system

- Implements event emission for transfers and approvals.
- Shows how to notify external systems of important contract actions.
- **Why it matters:** Events are critical for DApp frontends, wallets, and marketplaces to track changes.

### 09_erc721_safe_transfer.sol
**Topic:** Safe transfer

- Introduces safe math operations and secure zombie creation logic.
- Demonstrates best practices for preventing overflows and ensuring safe transfers.
- **Why it matters:** Safe transfers protect users and contracts from bugs and exploits.

### 10_erc721_contract.sol
**Topic:** Complete contract

- Combines all previous features into a full ERC721-compliant contract.
- Uses SafeMath for secure arithmetic and implements all required functions.
- **Why it matters:** A complete contract is ready for deployment and integration with the NFT ecosystem.

### 11_erc721_zombie.sol
**Topic:** Zombie-specific implementation

- Extends the ERC721 contract with zombie game logic and SafeMath for all types.
- Demonstrates how to build game-specific features on top of the standard.
- **Why it matters:** Custom logic enables unique, interactive NFTs and games.

### 12_erc721_marketplace.sol
**Topic:** Marketplace functionality

- Adds marketplace logic, including randomization and battle mechanics.
- Demonstrates how to use SafeMath for secure state updates.
- **Why it matters:** Marketplaces are essential for trading and liquidity in NFT ecosystems.

### 13_erc721_auction.sol
**Topic:** Auction system

- Implements an auction system with transfer and approval logic.
- Uses natspec comments for documentation and best practices.
- **Why it matters:** Auctions enable price discovery and advanced trading features for NFTs.

## Tips for Success
- Read the comments in each file carefullyâ€”they explain not just the "how" but the "why."
- Experiment with the code: try changing values, adding new functions, or breaking things to see what happens.
- Refer back to this README and the main course notes as needed.
- Practice writing your own contracts using these patterns and techniques.
