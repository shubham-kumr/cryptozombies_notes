## How to Use This Module
Each `.sol` file in this directory is a lesson focusing on a specific advanced game mechanic or Solidity concept. Files are heavily commented for clarity. Work through them in order for the best learning experience. Read the comments, experiment with the code, and refer back to the summaries below as needed.

## File-by-File Summaries

### 01_payable_functions.sol
**Topic:** Payable functions and modifiers

- Introduces payable functions, allowing contracts to receive Ether.
- Demonstrates the use of modifiers for access control and level requirements.
- **Why it matters:** Payable functions are essential for in-game purchases, upgrades, and economic features.

### 02_battle_system.sol
**Topic:** Battle system foundation

- Sets up the contract structure for implementing zombie battles.
- Prepares the codebase for adding attack and combat logic.
- **Why it matters:** A solid foundation is crucial for building complex, interactive game mechanics.

### 03_random_numbers.sol
**Topic:** Random number generation

- Shows how to generate pseudo-random numbers in Solidity using block data and nonces.
- Explains the limitations and security considerations of on-chain randomness.
- **Why it matters:** Randomness is key for fair battles, loot drops, and unpredictable gameplay.

### 04_zombie_attacks.sol
**Topic:** Attack mechanics

- Adds the structure for zombie attack functions, including randomness and victory probability.
- Prepares for implementing win/loss logic and rewards.
- **Why it matters:** Attacks are a core gameplay feature, requiring careful design for fairness and fun.

### 05_zombie_wins.sol
**Topic:** Win conditions

- Implements logic for determining and handling zombie victories in battle.
- Shows how to update zombie stats and trigger cooldowns after a win.
- **Why it matters:** Win conditions provide goals and rewards, motivating player engagement.

### 06_zombie_losses.sol
**Topic:** Loss conditions

- Adds logic for handling zombie losses, including stat updates and cooldowns.
- Demonstrates secure withdrawal patterns and fee management.
- **Why it matters:** Loss conditions balance the game and ensure fair play.

### 07_zombie_rewards.sol
**Topic:** Reward system

- Introduces a reward system for successful attacks.
- Shows how to use modifiers for access control and to ensure only owners can perform actions.
- **Why it matters:** Rewards incentivize participation and progression in the game.

### 08_zombie_leveling.sol
**Topic:** Leveling mechanics

- Implements a leveling system, tracking wins, losses, and progression.
- Shows how to update zombie stats and create new zombies with advanced attributes.
- **Why it matters:** Leveling adds depth, replayability, and a sense of achievement.

### 09_zombie_abilities.sol
**Topic:** Special abilities

- Adds special abilities and advanced attack logic for zombies.
- Demonstrates how to update stats and trigger new behaviors on victory.
- **Why it matters:** Abilities make gameplay more dynamic and strategic.

### 10_zombie_evolution.sol
**Topic:** Evolution system

- Implements evolution mechanics, allowing zombies to change and improve after battles.
- Handles both win and loss outcomes, updating stats and triggering cooldowns.
- **Why it matters:** Evolution keeps the game fresh and encourages long-term engagement.

### 11_withdrawals.sol
**Topic:** Withdrawal functionality

- Adds secure withdrawal functions for contract owners to collect fees.
- Demonstrates best practices for handling Ether in smart contracts.
- **Why it matters:** Secure withdrawals are essential for managing in-game economies and protecting funds.

## Tips for Success
- Read the comments in each file carefullyâ€”they explain not just the "how" but the "why."
- Experiment with the code: try changing values, adding new functions, or breaking things to see what happens.
- Refer back to this README and the main course notes as needed.
- Practice writing your own contracts using these patterns and techniques.
